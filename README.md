## Usage Guide

### Creating Notes

1. Click "New Note" button or press `Ctrl+N`

```

If the linked note doesn't exist, it will be created automatically as a stub.

2. Drag and drop an image onto the upload zone, or click to select
3. The Markdown image syntax will be inserted automatically

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+E` - Toggle edit mode
- `Ctrl+S` - Save note

### Backlinks

At the bottom of each note, you'll see which other notes link to the current note.

## Development

1. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Flask app**:
   ```powershell
   cd app
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Access at**: `http://localhost:5000`

## Data Persistence

Your data is stored in two locations:
- **Database**: `app/garden.json` - All note content and metadata
- **Images**: `app/static/uploads/` - Uploaded images

## Backup

To backup your garden:

```powershell
# Backup database and images
cp app/garden.json garden_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).json
cp -r app/static/uploads uploads_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```
